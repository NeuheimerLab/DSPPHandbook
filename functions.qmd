# Why you want to do it: 

Functions are at the core of all tasks in R.  Functions are an object that takes an action.


# How you can do it: 

## Anatomy of a function



<img src="./genFunction.png" align="center" width="600px"/>




Let's explore the anatomy of the function using the following example:

```{r}

sum(c(2,3))

```

Parts of a function:

* Function name (e.g. `sum`): This is like the name of your protocol (e.g., “DNA extraction”, “calculate_diversity”). It tells R which operation to perform. *Function names are always followed by curved brackets (parentheses) `()`*.

* Arguments (e.g. `c(2, 3)`): These are the inputs you provide to the function. Like the materials you need for a lab protocol: sample size, reagent volumes, temperature settings. Arguments go inside the parentheses `( )`. Multiple arguments are separated by commas (,). Arguments can be numbers, data objects, options in the function.  Note that arguments will often have a name.  You can see the available arguments in the help file.

* Output (`[1] 5`): This is the result the function returns. Like the final measurement from your experiment. [1] means this is the first element of the output The function processed the inputs and gave you `5`.

## Arithmetic operators

Most functions will take the form described above.  Exceptions to this include very common arithmetic operators.

**Arithmetic Operators include:**

| Operator | Description            |
|---------:|:-----------------------|
|       `+` | addition               |
|       `-` | subtraction            |
|       `*` | multiplication         |
|        `/` | division               |
|       `^` | exponentiation         |
| `sqrt()` | square-root            |
| `abs()` | absolute value |
| `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()` | trigonometric functions |
| `exp()` | exponential |
| `log()` | logarithm (default is base *e*, see help file for more) |



:::{.callout-caution collapse="false" title="Remember order of operations!"}

It is important to remember the order of operations when using arithmetic operators in R.  

R will evaluate your code following PEMDAS:

Parentheses > Exponents > Multiplication/Division > Addition/Subtraction

:::


Note: An important feature in `R` is element-wise operations. When you add two vectors, R adds corresponding elements together:

`c(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6)`

`c(1 + 4, 2 + 5, 3 + 6)`

`c(5, 7, 9)`

You can also use variables that store vectors:

`V1 <- c(1, 2, 3)`

`V2 <- c(4, 5, 6)`

`V3 <- V1 + V2`

where `V3` will then be a vector containing 5, 7, 9.

:::{.callout-caution collapse="false" title="Objects of different lengths!"}

BE CAREFUL THOUGH: R will allow you to do an element-wise operation even if the two vectors do not match in length.  For example:

```{r}
V4 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
print(V4)

V5 <- c(1, 2)
print(V5)

V4 + V5

```

Notice how the values in `V5` were repeated until they matched the length of `V4`.  This is often **not** what you want.  Another reason that it is important to take a look at your objects.

## Packages in R

Some functions come “preloaded” with R, while others you will have to load into R when you need them from a package. Think of these as things you can do with a basic game, and those you can do with an “expansion pack”.

Packages consist of collections of functions, etc. that help us accomplish various tasks in R.  Currently (d. 26/01/2026), [there are 23058 contributed packages available](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) and many others are listed outside this official list.

Installing packages in base R is a 2-step process.  First, you need to install the package from the web (you need internet access for this first step).  This is done with 

`install.packages("PackageName")`

where PackageName is the name of the package.  Note the quotations around the package name!  The first step only needs to be done once for a current version of R.  

The second step, loading the package, needs to be done each time you have a new R session (open R) and want to use a package (internet access not needed for this 2nd step).  Loading the package is done with:

`library(PackageName)`

Note that there are no quotes on the package name with the library function.

## Making your own function

To be added.
